   <h1>Welcome to my profils page, i'm Nicolas and here's my wolrd!</h1>
  	  <img src="images/profil.jpg"alt="Nicolas Dupont" id="logo">
  	  <p>I'm a big fan of pop culture, especially Japanese and American pop culture. My main interests are manga, anime and pop culture music. I also played football for many years, and the sport still occupies a huge place in my life. I'm currently a first-year student at EMLV, and my future plans are to work in the fashion industry. Working in a field compatible with my passion is essential for me.

  	 <h2>Manga/anime</h2>
  	  <p class="Manga/anime">I discovered this passion at a very young age when I was at primary school. It was my cousin who passed it on to me. I was immediately hooked on this world, but I'd never have thought about it to that extent. The works that have made the biggest impression on me are : </p>


 	  <p class="Manga/anime">naruto: this was my very first manga, I followed its publication for several years and grew up. Naruto is my favourite character, he helped and influenced me a lot during my adolescence and development. </p>
 	
 	    <p class="Manga/anime">HunterxHunter: This is my favourite manga and anime. It's a very difficult exercise to describe what this work represents for me. I can't even count on my fingers the number of times I've seen it. I can only recommend it to you.</p>

  	 <h2>Footbal</h2>
  	  <p>
  	   Football is my favourite sport, and I've been playing it for over 10 years. My favourite team for life is Manchester City.

       <p>
        Manchester City : I started supporting this club thanks to my favourite player Yaya Toure. I've experienced a lot with this club, but the last few years have been the best. Notably with our first Champions League win in 2023.
      </p>
        <p>
        Yaya Toure : One of the best players of his time, he inspired me a lot in my style of play. I identify a lot with this player for many reasons. I used to play in the same position, and what's more, he came from the town where I'm from in Côte d'Ivoire. My fondest memory is when we won the 2015 African Cup of Nations thanks to him, our captain.

  	 <h2>Music </h2>
  	  <p>I listen to a lot of music. I'd say it's my most visible passion at home. The type of music I listen to the most is Trap, which is why my favourite artists are Kaaris, Leto and Ninho. I also listen to a lot of other very different styles like R&B, K-pop and J-pop or even Couper decaler.</p>
